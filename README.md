# refactoring-example
In this assignment, your task is to modify the code of an application called LegacyApp. We assume that it is a certain legacy application and we want to improve the quality of its code. We want the code in the project ‘LegacyAppConsumer’ not to be modified. In other words, the code in this project cannot be modified.
Everything in the LegacyApp project can be modified - as long as it does not change the interface of the classes used in the LegacyAppConsumer project. Additionally, the UserDataAccess class and the AddUser static method cannot be modified. We assume that we cannot modify this class for certain reasons.
